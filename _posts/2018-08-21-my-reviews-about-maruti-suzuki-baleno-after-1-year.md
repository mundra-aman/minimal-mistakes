Build quality sucks to the core

Cheap interiors - Expected leather seats, atleast in the top model

Feature loaded - Main reason I bought it

Window rubber came off just after 8 months

Steering nuts went loose after 8 months, though was rectified during the third service

Engine is smooth and peppy, even after rough driving for an year

Steering feels harder at low speeds

Gear box - not so smooth

Don't feel confident behind the wheel at 110kph plus speeds

Infotainment system is slow and laggy

Android auto and Apple car play, both work like a charm

Mediocre music system and speakers

No rear AC vent
