## 01 Feb, 2021 Monday | Budget Day

The market witnessed selling pressure for six consecutive sessions, with the benchmark indices losing over a percent each in the week gone by. The BSE Sensex slipped 2,592.77 points, or 5.3 percent, to end at 46,285.77 and the Nifty50 fell 737.3 points or 5 percent to finish at 13,634.60
In the last week, the 30-share BSE benchmark tumbled 2,592.77 points or 5.30 per ent due to profit-booking ahead of the Union Budget.
The short term trend of Nifty continues to be weak. The negation of the upside bounce attempt and the downside break of weekly support signals more declines for the Nifty. The Union Budget could play a vital role to show the direction to the market. Any rise from here can face resistance at around 13,750-13,800. The near- term downside targets to be watched for is around 13,050 (20-week EMA).
The weak closing of Nifty-50 below 14,000-mark on the expiry day suggests more weakness in the market if the budget disappoints.
We need to wait and see how the Nifty closes on February 1 after the Budget to get the next directional move. On the upside, the recent peak of around 14,645 could be the major resistance.
The economic survey failed to trigger the rebound in the markets and now all eyes are on the Union Budget. 
The markets were successful in breaking 13,700 and closed below it too. It can slide further to 13,400 and 13,200. Any rally up can be utilised to short the Nifty for lower targets. The resistance is now at 14,000 and until that is not crossed, we will remain in the grip of the bears.

we are likely to enter a phase of outperformance of banks.


## 08 Feb, 2021 Monday

The just-concluded RBI policy meet reaffirms our conviction that growth is coming back. Along the way, challenges remain, even as the Budget has raised expectations significantly. In the coming week, a batch of macro data points is in the pipeline. And not to forget, some big names are flashing on the earnings dashboard
The Budget speech is long over, but the feel-good factor is still resonating.
The market clocked the biggest ever weekly gains in absolute terms, with the benchmark indices hitting new highs as the bulls, backed by the banking sector, dominated the week ended February 5.
Use dips to buy! Nifty50 could test 15,500 in February series
The markets achieved a historic feat by attaining the highest-ever jump on Budget Day in a decade. Both, the Nifty50 and Sensex rallies were primarily fuelled by the Budget which brought with it immense optimism and positive economic reforms that aimed at economic growth through infrastructure development, capex incentives, privatisation, and asset monetisation.
The market is likely to remain bullish as there is no significant negative news event in the near term. On the downside, 14600 is established as immediate support and any break of the same will lead to short-term weakness in the market.
Nifty formed an indecisive 'Doji' kind of candle formation on the daily scale and a long bullish candle on the weekly chart on Friday.
Continuing the selling spree for the eighth consecutive month, mutual funds pulled out Rs 12,980 crore from equities in January as surge in markets provided an opportunity to book profits.
The markets, despite withdrawals from mutual funds in the past few months, have continued to rise as flows from FPIs have been robust.
Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have put in Rs 19,472 crore in the Indian equity markets in January after investing Rs 1.7 lakh crore in 2020.
The surge in the markets has provided investors an opportunity to book profit. That could have led investors redeem their investments, resulting in mutual funds pulling out investments from equity markets in January.

The Nifty opened on a positive note on February 8 and extended higher for the sixth straight session. As a result, it has crossed the 15,000-mark on a closing basis. Going ahead, 15,250 is the key level to watch out for.
Nifty has to continue to hold above 15,000 zones to continue its bullish momentum towards 15,250 then 15,500, while support can be seen around 15,000 and then 14,750 zones.
The Indian market rallied for a sixth day in a row, pushing benchmark indices to record highs yet again on February 8, as the S&P BSE Sensex hit 51,523 and the Nifty50 15,159.
The Sensex rose 617 points to 51,348, while the Nifty50 closed with gains of 191 points at 15,115.
Investors are advised to stay long on the index as it is still a buy on dips market.
India VIX moved up by 2.30 percent from 23.41 to 23.95 levels. Now, VIX needs to cool down and hold below 21 for the momentum to continue.
The Nifty formed a small-bodied bullish candle on a daily scale and continues its higher highs-higher lows formation of the last six sessions.
The bulls continued to dominate the benchmark indices following supportive global cues. The Nifty index ended higher by 1.3 percent to close above the 15,100.
We are eyeing 15,200 in the Nifty and going forward earnings and global cues will dictate the market trend. Domestic market participants would actively track key macro data like IIP, CPI and WPI data.
Overall we expect the market to continue its upward journey on the back of healthy corporate earnings, strong liquidity; positive developments on the vaccine front, broad based economic recovery and low interest rates.



## 09 Feb, 2021 Tuesday

Sensex, Nifty rally 10% since Budget Day to hit record highs
Both Sensex and Nifty50 have rallied by more than 10 percent each since Budget to touch a lifetime high of 51,514, and 15,153, respectively, on February 8.
Benchmark indices more than doubled from the March 2020 low caused by the outbreak of the pandemic, but the recovery was swift and the market did not give much time to investors to buy the dip.
For investors who are already sitting on profit should use the rally to book some profits, suggest experts. The rally could extend towards 15,500 in February series, and to 16,000 in the year 2021 on the Nifty50
Although the market is high, we don't see the market is overvalued in terms of the fundamentals but we believe that the market sentiment is at the peak of optimism and an adjustment of it is more likely
We recommend the investors liquidate 30-40 percent of their holding at the current level at its maximum and wait for a 6-10 percent correction to re-enter or add into the existing portfolio
The Budget 2021 has made most of the sectors attractive. The action will be focused on the economy-related sectors as well as consumption. Investors will not look for stocks that are on a growth path; hence, small & midcaps could do well.
Dips should be used to accumulate quality stocks. We have often seen that correction of 5-8% in benchmark indices in a short period of time along with 10-12% decline in quality companies is always a good opportunity to add/accumulate. Invest for the long haul, do not be too greedy or too fearful.
If the growth starts to pick up, then mid and smallcaps may start to do well compared to the largecaps.

Indian market snapped a 6-day winning streak and closed flat after hitting a record high on February 9. The S&P BSE Sensex touched a record high of 51,835 while the Nifty50 touched a high of 15,257 during the day.
Nifty remained volatile as it traded in a wider range of 150 points but ended on a flattish note. It formed a small Bodied Candle on the daily scale but continues its higher highs - higher lows formation of the last seven sessions
market is overstretched and last-hour selling pressure indicated a strong possibility of quick intraday correction from the current levels. Technically, the index has formed a Hammer kind of candlestick pattern which clearly indicates indecisiveness between bulls and bears.



## 10 Feb, 2021 Wednesday

The market ended flat for the second day in a row in a highly volatile session on February 10. At close, the Sensex was down 19.69 points or 0.04% at 51,309.39, and the Nifty was down 2.80 points or 0.02% at 15,106.50.
Previous few weeks have been quite volatile where in Nifty witnessed a 7.5 percent correction and an equally strong bounce back to scale new highs. The medium-term undertone continues to be extremely positive; in the near term, some consolidation is expected before the up move resumes. We believe 14,700-14,800 is a strong entry range for the index and on the higher side one can expect 15,700-16,000. IT and select BFSI stocks look positive while metals and realty are expected to witness consolidation
Among sectors, buying witnessed in auto, IT, pharma names, while some selling seen in the banking and infra stocks.
Nifty formed a Doji candle on daily scale with a long lower shadow indicating dips were being bought in the market.
Nifty has to hold above 15000 to continue its bullish momentum towards 15200 and 15250 zones while on the downside major support can be seen around 14850 and 14750 zones
For the next few trading sessions, 15270/51900 should act as a trend decider level, above which we can expect a breakout rally towards 15315-15350/52500-53000
Indian market closed in the red for the second consecutive day in a row on February 10 pushing benchmark indices lower, but a smart bounce back towards the close of the day capped the losses.
This suggests that bulls have not left the party yet.
The market manages to hold above the Nifty 50 Index support level of 15000. The technical factors are aligned to support a range-bound market movement in the coming week.
The Nifty opened on a positive note however faced selling pressure as the day progressed. The index came down to fill up the gap area of 15041-15014. The hourly chart shows that the index moved lower to test the hourly lower Bollinger Band where the selling was absorbed.
As long as Nifty shows similar consolidation for the next 1-2 sessions then odds of sharp upside bounce can't be ruled out
Another high wave type candle was formed with minor upper and long lower shadow. Technically, this pattern again signals confusion among participants at the highs, which is now leading to volatility. But the formation of long lower shadow could signal an emergence of sharp buying on dips



## 11 Feb, 2021 Thursday



## 12 Feb, 2021 Friday
The market inched closer to record high levels but erased all its gains in the last couple of sessions amid volatility to end flat.
Nifty formed a Doji pattern on the daily charts while forming a small bullish candle on the weekly scale.
Selling pressure was in FMCG, metals and pharma stocks. However, banking & financials provided strong support.

During the week we saw maximum activity in medium-sized and small-sized companies. Going ahead, these mid and small-size companies could hurt the market if the Nifty50 index fails to break the 15,260 levels.
The broader markets outperformed frontliners on the weekly basis. The Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 indices gained 2.18 percent and 3.85 percent

Budget & MPC – Twin Impact on Markets - Post a momentous Budget and MPC week, markets opened with the residual firepower but slowed down and consolidated for most of the week. Despite this, Nifty attained highs of 15,257 for the first time in history.

## 15 Feb, 2021 Monday
For the week ended February 12, Sensex and Nifty50 closed with gains of 1.6 percent.
If the Nifty50 index crosses 15,270 for the 15,500 levels, it would be advisable to buy.
Fall below 15,100 will lead to further weakness.
A break below 15,000 would be an interesting one to participate in. In this scenario, a healthy profit-booking towards 14,600 – 14,400 cannot be ruled out
The market is now constrained within the immediate support and resistance of 14970 and 15250 and a break on either side will dictate the trend for the upcoming week.

Based on the chart of largecap companies, the weakness is increasing in the short-term, and it would probably lead to a quick correction to the level of 14,850 or 14,750. 
According to pivot charts, the key support levels for the Nifty are placed at 15,081.7, followed by 15,000.1. If the index moves up, the key resistance levels to watch out for are 15,244.2 and 15,325.1.

Nifty50 had a gap-up opening today and touched a record high of 15313, after showing signs of consolidation last week.
Sensex also reached record high level of 52000 for the first time.
stay long but consolidation could continue in the coming week, but at the same time small & midcaps might continue to outperform. The level of 15,300 – 15,000 will be seen as a crucial range and a breakout on either side is likely to dictate the direction of the market.
The pragmatic strategy would be to wait for some sort of trend deciding action and then one should be looking to place aggressive bets

Indian share markets benchmarks BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 scaled fresh lifetime highs on Monday, on the back of firm global cues, upbeat Q3 earnings and strong foreign fund inflows
Strong global cues and consistent buying by the FIIs helped the Indian market to hit fresh record highs.
NBFC sector was in uptrend today.
Nifty has strong resistance at 15,300 in the form of maximum concentration of Call OI for this week’s expiry as of now. On technical charts, the zone of 15300-15500 seems to be a very stiff and strong resistance area.
One may look for profit booking in financials, rate sensitive and high beta stocks in favor of traditionally defensive sectors going ahead from here. While on the lower side, supports are placed at 15000 and 14850 for the immediate near term.
Given the strength of the global markets and the CPI inflation figures, Nifty/Sensex can rise to the level of 15500/52500 levels and that could be the time to shift the portfolio from weak stocks to strong large-cap companies

## 16 Feb, 2021 Tuesday

The index opened the day with gap-up gains, but was not able to hold the gains for long and witnessed a profit booking and closed the day on a flattish note at 15318.
Bears tried to take control of D-Street in the second half of the trading sessions on Tuesday but bulls gave a tough fight and narrowed losses towards the close of the trade.
Market, though volatile, kept its momentum during the morning hours, however, failing to hold on to it due to a weak opening of European markets. The downfall was aggravated by private banks, IT, and FMCG stocks while mid and small caps continued their outperformance.

The Nifty 50 Index is still holding above the support level of 15250. It is critical to sustaining above the 15250 Nifty50 Index level to keep the short-term positive trend intact.
If nifty50 breaks out above 15370, initiate buying and look for an exit around 15520. Overall, the investor should maintain a stop below 15250.
15250 will act as immediate support followed by 15100 odd levels. If the index holds the above-said levels then we may see the current momentum extend further towards the immediate hurdle zone of 15400-15500 zone.

The recent consolidation in the index is in line with expectations and the market is expected to continue on bullish momentum based on current price action.
