# MBA core courses
 
## Corporate Finance
The main objective of the course is to develop insight into the process by which firms can create value for their shareholders 
by formulating strategies in which finance is a crucial competitive weapon. 
Topics include discounted cash flow models, risk and return, capital asset pricing model, capital market efficiency, capital structure and the cost of capital, dividend policy, and leasing.

The course looks at how users of financial information interpret accounting reports when making business decisions. 
The emphasis is on profitability concepts and performance evaluation. 

## Managerial Statistics

Topics include basic data analysis, random variables and probability distributions, sampling distributions, interval estimation, hypothesis testing and regression. 
Numerous examples are chosen from quality-control applications, finance, marketing and management.

## Managerial Economics
This courseâ€™s objective is to give you insight into how markets function. The decisions made by individual managers and consumers generate the fundamentals of market supply and demand, 
governing the prices and quantities sold in all economic transactions. 
As a manager seeking to maximize firm value, understanding your market(s) is crucial to achieving your goals. 
The first part of the course examines how managers make day-to-day decisions about running their businesses when their product is sold in a market that works efficiently. 
It will also address what types of industries are most likely to be efficient, either by default (commodities such as wheat and copper) or by design (electricity markets).

The second part of the course examines the decision making process when, for various reasons, a firm has market power. 
This refers to all situations where an individual firm has a direct influence on the market price of the product. 
We will discuss how managers can use this influence to generate firm value and set out situations in which managers can try to increase their market power. 
We will also use the tools developed along the way to understand the implications of market failure and some public policy solutions to economic inefficiency. 
Managerial economics is an important component of the MBA program. Its focus on how individuals make optimal decisions in different circumstances underpins much of both the core 
and elective curriculum. 

## Strategy Formulation
This course is about the determinants of firm performance. It develops an explanation for why some firms perform better than others, and presents the analytical tools 
required to formulate successful strategies. Students will learn to analyze firms' competitive environments and to design a strategy that specifies appropriate long-term goals 
for a corporation, the businesses in which it will compete, how it will serve customers better than its competitors, and the capabilities that will be required in the service 
of these objectives. Learning is primarily through discussion of cases and articles with supporting short lectures and written assignments.

## Marketing
Marketing activity is the engine that creates value in a business. It provides the focus for interfacing with customers and the source of intelligence about customers, 
competitors and the general environment. Further, marketing focuses on the long-run relationship of a company to its customers as well as on short-run sales. 
Thus marketing is critical to the revenue and profit streams for a company. This course emphasizes the role of marketing in creating value for customers, which in turn creates value
