[^,]*
		[^,]* means "match any number of characters that are not commas", which I think it exactly what you are trying to do here. You may want to anchor it to the beginning of the string iwth ^, like this:

^[^,]*





/^([^,]*,){21}[^,]*$/
That is:

^     Start of string
(     Start of group
[^,]* Any character except comma, zero or more times
,     A comma
){21} End and repeat the group 21 times
[^,]* Any character except comma, zero or more times again
$     End of string




^(?:[^,]*+,){21}[^,]*+$
The Possessive quantifier can be better performance than a Greedy quantifier.


Explanation:

(?x)    # enables comments, so this whole block can be used in a regex.
^       # start of string
(?:     # start non-capturing group
[^,]*+  # as many non-commas as possible, but none required
,       # a comma
)       # end non-capturing group
{21}    # 21 of previous entity (i.e. the group)
[^,]*+  # as many non-commas as possible, but none required
$       # end of string




Exactly 21 commas:

^([^,]*,){21}[^,]$
At least 21 commas:

^([^,]?,){21}.*$
