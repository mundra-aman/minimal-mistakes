http://www.hydraze.org/2015/08/ashley-madison-full-dump-has-finally-leaked/
TL;DR :
The leaked files seem totally legit
33 million accounts and user personal information have leaked
36 million email addresses have leaked (you might get some spam…)
Accounts’ passwords were stored in a secure way and while they won’t be cracked as a whole, someone targeting you might crack your password. Change it.
The leak contains the names, street addresses, email addresses, phone number and credit card transactions of nearly 33 million accounts ! (and Per Thorsheim has found valid CC info !)
The dump was made on 11/07/15 (July). If you registered your account after this date, you are mostly safe. If you registered before, your personal information are at risk and I advise you to take measures to protect yourself from identity/credit card theft.


Involves the stolen personal data of almost 32 million Ashley Madison users going back to 2007, including names, birth dates, and partial credit card numbers.

On August 18, 2015 hackers released data on more than 36 million users from Ashley Madison. 

How many accounts were compromised?
About 36 million, including some duplicate email addresses.

Instructions to extract all emails with specific domain name on windows machine
1) Change file extension for aminno_member_email.dump to .txt
2) Copy the code below into a txt file. save it. then change it's file extension to .vbs
3) Edit two variables in the code: file_path and search_text
4) Run the vbs file.
it creates a new txt file in the same location as the vbs. The script loops through the 36 million emails, if it sees the variable search_text, it will write it to the newly created txt file called "results".
it took about 1.5 hours on my old laptop.
I'm from Canada so I was curious about government email addresses. I found 629 government addresses (.gc.ca). I have a friend who used to work for Royal Bank of Canada so I tried that as well (rbc.com), 158 matches. fun times! In both cases, the emails show the account users name (ex. FirstName.LastName.rbc.com)

Copy the code below:

'Variables
file_path = "[YOUR FILE PATH HERE]aminno_member_email.txt"
search_text = ".gc.ca"
email_counter = 0
positive_counter = 0
search_start = Time
'Open the file for reading
Set objFileToRead = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject").OpenTextFile(file_path, 1) 
'Set up file for writing
Set myFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
Set objFileToWrite = myFSO.OpenTextFile("results.txt", 2, true)
'Alert the process has started
msgbox "Process started"
'Loop through each line
do while not objFileToRead.AtEndOfStream

read_line = objFileToRead.ReadLine()
line_array = Split(read_line, "),(")
For i = 0 to UBound(line_array)
email_counter = email_counter + 1
if InStr(line_array(i), search_text) > 0 then 
positive_counter = positive_counter + 1
write_email = left(line_array(i), (Len(line_array(i))-14))
objFileToWrite.WriteLine(write_email)
end if
Next
loop 
'Add statistical info
search_end = Time
objFileToWrite.WriteLine("Emails searched: " & email_counter & ". Emails found: " & positive_counter & ". Start: " & search_start & ". End: " & search_end & ".")
'clean up
objFileToRead.Close 
Set objFileToRead = Nothing 
objFileToWrite.Close
Set objFileToWrite = Nothing
'WScript.Quit
'Alert the process is complete
msgbox "Process complete"



//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

over 36 million Ashley Madison accounts and 9 million individual credit card transactions.

Creation date and last updated date, down to the second
Account type and membership status (listed as a 0, 1, 2, or 3)
First and last name (at least, the one given) and nickname
Listed street address, including city, state, zip code, and in some cases even the latitude and longitude lines
Up to three phone numbers, including work and mobile (if provided)
Gender (approximately 27 million male-identified and 4.4 million female-identified accounts, which is about a 6-to-1 ratio with 2 million undetermined)
Date of birth
Profile caption (examples include "No Games Please." and "I May Be Spoken 4 But I Speak 4 Myself")
Weight and height, the latter of which seems to be listed in centimeters
Certain attributes — ethnicity, body type, whether you drink or smoke, what you're initially seeking, and what you're relationship status is — are listed as just a number instead of a full text value. There's no key provided, but certain numbers can be discerned in context (e.g. ethnicity "1" seems to be white, while "3" is Asian)
What you're open to, what you're looking for, and what turns you on — all listed as an array of numbers (presumably corresponding to a menu of options), a self-submitted description, or a combination of the two
Security questions (listed as a number; for example "2" might represent what high school you went to) and answers (in text)

As far as passwords go, everything seems to be protected using bcrypt, which is to say you might be okay provided you used a strong enough password. Security questions are listed as a number, presumably referencing some other data (for example, "2" seems to be what high school you went to), and security answers are given in text.


9,693,860 CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN 2008 AND 2015

Then there is almost 3GB of transaction data — 2,643 CSV files in all, each of which seems to represent an individual day between March 21st, 2008 and June 28th, 2015, although there are 2,655 days in between. Early estimates suggest there are 9,693,860 credit card transactions listed in total.

Each transaction listed has the a timestamp (tracked to the nearest minute), the last four digits of the credit card, the "brand" of card (VI for Visa, MC for Master Card, AM for American Express, DI for Discover), the reported amount of the transaction, the full name (presumably legit for billing purposes) and email address associated with the card, and several columns of other information we currently can't discern


Those 9.69 million transactions don't represent individual users, mind you — many people were repeat customers several times over. This is just a sampling of what can be found with even a cursory glance at the leaked data, and while the full extent of information varies by account, if you've ever used Ashley Madison, this should definitely give you cause for concern.

Ashley Madison Data analysis: 86% male, 30-46 is the trouble zone; 

The data dump contains the usernames, first names, last names, street addresses and more of some 33 million users. Partial credit card details are also included in the file, along with records documenting 9.6 million transactions and 36 million email addresses going back seven years. Among the email addresses were more than 15,000 accounts created with US .mil or .gov email addresses.

Passwords included in the leak are hashed using the secure bcrypt algorithm. The difficulty and cost of decrypting the entire database passwords means they will likely remain encrypted, but any users of Ashley Madison should change their password and any duplicates.

Physical descriptions created by users are also in the data dump. Eye colour, weight, height, hair colour, body type and ethnicity all included, along with relationship status, what a user is looking for, if they drink alcohol, smoke, their security question and date of birth. According to the 'gender' field in the database, 80 percent of Ashley Madison's users are male (28 million), with 14 percent (5 million) female and five percent (2 million) not specified.


alright bitches. since too many people complained how to open the dump files, instead of extracting data, im gonna show you how to read the data yourselves. call me Brave Wanderer, your pal for now.
 
here's the index of what we're going to do. don't worry, im gonna show you step-by-step of everything.
 
-OPSEC
-SOURCE
-FILE STRUCTURE
-VERIFY
-EXTRACT
-MYSQL
-IMPORTING DUMP
-READING DUMP
 
==================== OPSEC ====================
 
first rule: STFU. no matter what, dont fucking go around and tell people you grabbed ~9 GB of shit because it's cool. don't do this shit on Windows or Mac. get a new and cheap laptop with cash. do full disk encryption on your HDD. use VPN like AirVPN and Viking to securely download the shit. dont download it from your home.
 
grab a copy of Kali Linux from kali.org. my reason for this is you dont have to set up LAMP by yourself. kali is preconfigured with MySQL and PHP. burn it onto a DVD. install kali, which offer full disk encrypt. after install login as root and type in your password. connect to not-from-your-home Wifi and load up VPN.

==================== VERIFY ====================
 
import pubkey:
gpg --import 74ABAA38.txt
 
verify (example):
gpg --with-fingerprint am_am.dump.gz.asc
 
==================== EXTRACT ====================
 
as you could see there are two type of archives, 7zip and gzip. kali is preinstalled with both. extraction take at least 5-10 min for each of them depend on your laptop speed so be patient.
 
gzip extract:
gzip -d *.gz
 
7zip extract:
7z e *.7z
 
==================== MYSQL ====================
 
although kali mysql's password set to blank, you won't be able to login without reseting it.
 
stop mysql:
/etc/init.d/mysql stop
 
start mysql without pass:
mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &
 
if it isn't going, press enter again
 
connect to mysql:
mysql -u root
 
follow these instructions:
mysql> use mysql;
mysql> update user set password=PASSWORD("REPLACE-THIS-WITH-YOUR-PASSWORD") where User='root';
mysql> flush privileges;
mysql> quit
 
start the mysql server again:
/etc/init.d/mysql start
 
login (enter pass when prompted Enter Password):
mysql -u root -p
 
create new db (example):
mysql> create database fuck_madison;
mysql> show databases;
(if you see DB the it's verified)
 
let's quit:
mysql> quit
 
==================== IMPORTING DUMP ====================
 
importing dump (example):
mysql -u root -p -h localhost fuck_madison < member_login.dump
 
(this dump is ~1.6 GB and took me 1 hours to import, maybe different for you. be patient)
 
==================== READING DUMP ====================
 
once done. login again:
mysql -u root -p
 
mysql> use fuck_madison;
mysql> select * from member_login

OMG! This is what everyone said as soon as this dataset became public. I had actually already been thinking about this dataset for awhile wondering if it would become public, and if so, what kind of analysis could a legit data scientist do.
So pushing aside your opinions about the data, what it means, and the ethics of whether or not looking at the data is even ok blah, blah, blah….  hell, let’s take a look :)
Where Do You Get It? 
Google it dumbass. Well, you might have an easier time finding it on the dark web, but if you use reddit you should be fine. I was able to get my torrent link on PirateBay: https://thepiratebay.la/user/impactteam/  After you download the 9.6 Gb torrent you should see:

These are compressed so you have to uncompress the dumps using gunzip, standup a temp mysql database and import each database you want to browse 
mysql -u root -p -h localhost am_am < am_am.dump 
After that you can fire up python and start looking at the data. So for this post we will look at the largest dump, am_am. Looking at just 100,000 rows this is what you might see for summary df.describe().transpose():
Here is a complete list of columns, some where not included in describe().
What Should We Look At?
Most people gravitate towards the location data. Taking lat/long we can do a scatter plot with heat for density:

Something seems a little off on these coordinates, I’m no map expert, maybe I’ll come back to make an epic map image later. Moving on we see dob so we can get age, any guesses on the distribution? Looks like >30 is the trouble zone with a median of 46. 

So how many of these were dudes and how many of these were women? In the database there is a gender 1 and gender 2. The distribution was 13.9% versus 86.1%, I’m no genius, but I would say I am pretty sure gender 2 is male. 

There are hundreds directions a data nerd could go with this, you could look at gender specific distributions, models, word clouds, etc… An easy spin would be to review the map again but this time coloring gender.
Now the colors show women (red) versus men (blue). 
Depending on the interest from this I may do a series of articles looking into the text analytics and even build some predictive models or word clouds by gender. Comment below or message me privately if you have other ideas of analysis that someone should do with this dataset. Combining with geo-political and/or wealth is also another option.
