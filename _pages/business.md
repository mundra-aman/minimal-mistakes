**Roughly defined, a business is a repeatable process that:**

> * Creates and delivers something of value, 
  * that other people want or need, at a price they’re willing to pay, in a way that satisfies the customer’s needs and expectations, so that the business brings in sufficient profit to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation.

* A venture that doesn’t create value for others is a hobby.
* A venture that doesn’t attract attention is a flop.
* A venture that doesn’t sell the value it creates is a non-profit.
* A venture that doesn’t deliver what it promises is a scam.
* A venture that doesn’t bring in enough money to keep operating will inevitably close.
